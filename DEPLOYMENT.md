# Deployment Guide

## Environment Variables

Set these in your Vercel project settings:

### Required
- `NEYNAR_API_KEY` - Your Neynar API key for Farcaster data
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL` - Your deployed app URL (e.g., https://your-app.vercel.app)

### Optional
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY` - Base App MiniKit API key for enhanced features
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string (for future database features)
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection string (for caching and webhooks)

## Quick Setup

1. **Get Neynar API Key**
   - Go to [Neynar](https://neynar.com/)
   - Sign up and get your API key
   - Add to Vercel as `NEYNAR_API_KEY`

2. **Set App URL**
   - After deploying, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL` to your exact Vercel URL
   - This ensures cookies work properly for authentication

3. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Vercel will auto-detect Next.js
   - Build should complete successfully

## Testing

1. **Web Authentication**

## Troubleshooting

- **Build errors**: All type errors and linting issues have been resolved
- **Base App issues**: Use web SIWE flow for now (works inside Base App webview)
